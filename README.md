# Would You Rather Project

## Overview

Would You Rather is a game of choice. For each item, you are presented with two options,
and you must vote for which option you would rather do.

### Home

On the home screen you are presented with all of the questions. They are divided into
two lists - answered and unanswered. Click on a question to view more details or to
vote. Click on the button under the title to toggle between answered and unanswered questions.

### Question Details

If you have not yet answered the question, you will be presented with each option, along
with the avatar of the person who submitted the question. To vote, click the option you
want to choose.

Once you have answered the question, you will no longer be able to select an option. You
will also see how many people have voted for each option, as well as the percentage of votes
for each.

### Add a Question

On this page, there are two inputs. Enter one option in each input and click submit. The
question will now be available for all to vote.

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard shows the score for each user. The score is made up of the number of
questions submitted as well as the number of questions answered. Users are ranked
from highest to lowest score.
